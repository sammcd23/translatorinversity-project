a gov.uk translator user fed to be used by all

README file
Project: GOV.UK Worldwide User Fed Translator

The idea for this project is to create a prototype for a website with the idea that all people who need access to gov.uk can be granted it here due to other users who will input their own translations which can be read and rated by all other users of the site. This means a large amount of translations can be made for various languages, age groups, summaries and much more can be made.

Starting the project: 
The first part of the project must be a page which looks like a site with a home page, and a page to input translations along with a name of who they'll be credited to.
