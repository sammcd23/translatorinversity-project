Project: GOV.UK Worldwide User Fed Translator

The idea for this project is to create a prototype for a website with the idea that all people who need access to gov.uk can be granted it here due to other users who will input their own translations which can be read and rated by all other users of the site. This means a large amount of translations can be made for various languages, age groups, summaries and much more can be made.

First I thought it was worth adding a title for the site, "GOV.UK Universal Translations" and a search box for when inevitably I add pages to actually be searched for. I used some simple html along with some styling in css to make a centred title and search box.
