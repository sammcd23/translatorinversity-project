a gov.uk translator user fed to be used by all

README file
Project: GOV.UK Worldwide User Fed Translator

The idea for this project is to create a prototype for a website with the idea that all people who need access to gov.uk can be granted it here due to other users who will input their own translations which can be read and rated by all other users of the site. This means a large amount of translations can be made for various languages, age groups, summaries and much more can be made.

Installation: To run the project, simply download the files "index.html", "translationinput.html","search_results.html" and open index.html to open the home page.

Features: The web pages currently allow for a few features-
Opening translationinput.html from file or via homepage allows you to input a translation which is for now stored in local storage as this is a prototype.
Search results page shows results containing the query input on the home page, this is searched for with the "Page Name" input on translationinput.html, so search for pages by Page Name after submitting one.
Simple home buttons are present on each page to search for other pages.
Notice- You will need to input a translation with an author name, page name, language and translation before searching for results, as there are no placeholder translations to test.

Known Issues- Make sure to try the pages on a few different browsers, as I have already found that the localstorage on firefox does not work with the search results page.
            - If 2 pages of the same PageName are submitted, the second will not appear in search results
